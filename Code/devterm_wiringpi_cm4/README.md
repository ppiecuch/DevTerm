:warning: This library was deprecated by its author in August 2019. As of 31st October 2023 nobody has shown an interest in properly maintaining it. Between this, and changes to GPIO in Rasberry Pi OS Bookworm and on the Raspberry Pi 5, this project is going nowhere. It has been archived to more clearly indicate this status.

WiringPi (Unofficial Mirror/Fork)
=================================

This is an unofficial mirror/fork of wiringPi to support ports (Python/Ruby/etc).  With the
[end of official development](https://web.archive.org/web/20220405225008/http://wiringpi.com/wiringpi-deprecated/), this repository
has become a mirror of the last "official" source release, plus a fork facilitating updates
to support newer hardware (primarily for use by the ports) and fix bugs.

  * The final "official" source release can be found at the
    [`final_source_2.50`](https://github.com/WiringPi/WiringPi/tree/final_official_2.50) tag.
  * The default `master` branch contains code that has been written since that final source
    release to provide support for newer hardware.
